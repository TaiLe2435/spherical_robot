# spherical_robot

This repository is for my research project at Northern Illinois University. We are developing a small-sized omnidirectional spherical robot that will allow for low level control. It is still in its early stages of development.

Currently, there is a working vision tracking system, wireless communication, IMU orientation software, and a V1 robot design. Future work consists of developing a V2 of the robot that is smaller and more robust, as well as developing a control algorithm for the new system.
